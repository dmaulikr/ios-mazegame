============
A maze generator for iOS that works from Prim's Algorithm to generate random mazes each time the user clicks "New Maze".
Currently working on:
1) Win condition (didBeginContact not working for some reason)
2) Points system based on number of mazes solved in sitting, high score system
3) Adjustable difficulty level (drawing dimensions)
